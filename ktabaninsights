From the readings this week, I was able to understand importance of the concept of theory in digital humanities. The concept of hack-yack was also
scrutinized in the readings wherein  both were stated to be important in the field. Previously, I had this notion that
hack and yack compose a dichotomy but apparently, they actually support each other.
